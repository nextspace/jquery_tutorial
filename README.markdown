Tuesday March 16th. jQuery.
============================

    (from the homepage: http://jquery.com)

    jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document
    traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web
    development. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript.


Right here at Nextspace:
------------------------
There will be jQuery. Whole lots of it. We will learn how cool javascript is,
what you can do with it, and how to apply it to enhance your existing web apps.

Rather than a lecture, we will *interactively* learn how to use jQuery by using
your browser's console (we'll be using Safari on Mac and Chrome if you are PC) to
practice live coding on a basic HTML page.

    If you are a Windows user please download Chrome (http://www.google.com/chrome/),
    unless you already are a die-hard Firefox (w/ Firebug) user.

We will go beyond the console and show how you can build on the basics and write more
complex features for your project. If you're familiar with jQuery already, bring your
knowledge and help others--or heckle me, or help. Chris Burbridge will be there to
help out too.

Tutorial Topics
---------------
We will stop for a few questions and tangents but this will be the list of things we try to cover.

* overview, installation, how to get jQuery into your pages
* how to select elements and perform actions upon them
* how to respond to events (e.g., "user clicks X, Bob Barker pops out of a cake and neuters your dog.")
* how to get asynchronous with your web app (finally learn what "AJAX" means, and move beyond buzzword-compliance)
* plus valuable tips and tricks on how to introspect your code and debug baffling problems
