On History
----------

    "[JavaScript] went from non-existence to global adoption in an
    alarmingly short period of time. It never had an interval in the
    lab when it could be tried out and polished."

Straight into Netscape Navigator 2 and around the world.


Why is JavaScript Important?
----------------------------

* it's language of the web browser!


JavaScript
----------

* functions are first-class objects
* the first lambda language to go mainstream
* "It is Lisp in C's clothing"
* object literal notation _{}_
* prototype-based inheritance (i.e., no classes)
